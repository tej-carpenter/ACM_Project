            <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
            <p>Infotrek, an Inter-Departmental Technical Symposium, held under ACM, runs over few days, bringing in the
                indigenous minds of the Campus under one roof thereby giving a stiff competition. It is a blend of both
                Technical and Non-technical events. Technical events comprising of Coding, Web-designing, Hacking,
                De-bugging, etc. The Non-technical has in its back, events such as Dumb Charades, Quiz, Treasure Hunt,
                Online game, etc to test your vocal and managerial skills. And the endeavours are rewarded with cash
                prizes. Last but not the least, Who is the Star of the Event? The answer to this question hinges on the
                performance of the best performers in this closing event. Infotrek bridges the gap between all the
                departments and builds a platform to communicate well among the same. It is not just a meet but 'Fun in
                the Run'.</p>
